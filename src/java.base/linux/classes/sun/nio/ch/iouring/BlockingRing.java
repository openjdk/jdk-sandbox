/**
 * An IOUringImpl with blocking semantics. Two implementations currently provided.
 *
 * A single threaded ring performs all work in the calling thread. Therefore, only
 * one operation can be in flight at a time
 *
 * A multi threaded ring allows multiple threads to use one ring. This currently
 * uses two background threads to manage the Submission queue and completion queue
 * respectively.
 *
 * These implementations are mainly provided for testing/experimental purposes.
 * It's likely that real IOUringImpl use cases will be based on the lower level
 * asynchronous API
 *
 * {@link IOURingSocket} and {@link IOURingFile} are example APIs built on
 * the blocking API.
