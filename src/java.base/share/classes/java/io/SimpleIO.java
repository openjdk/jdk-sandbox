     * A user inputs a string or signals end-of-stream in a system-dependant
     * manner.
     *
     * To input a string, a user typically presses the "enter" key;
     * alternatively, on Unix, the user presses Control-J (^J) or
     * Control-M (^M) key combinations. To signal and end-of-stream,
     * a user can press Control-D (^D) on Unix or Ctrl+Z on Windows
     * key combination.
     *
     * <p> A programmer can use this method to input an integer number,
     * for example, as follows:
     * {@snippet :
     *    int i = ...;
     *    for (String s; (s = input("int?")) != null;) {
     *        try {

     *        } catch (NumberFormatException _) {}
     *    }
     *    println(i);
     *}
     * A programmer can take a similar approach to input other primitives or
     * arbitrary big numbers, such as {@link java.math.BigInteger#BigInteger(String)}
     * and {@link java.math.BigDecimal#BigDecimal(String)}.
     *
     * <p> A programmer should take care not to mix different way of reading
     * from the standard input. That is, a programmer should choose between
     * {@link System#in}, {@link System#console}, this method, or some other
     * access to standard input and should stick to that choice in the
     * context of a program.
